**TODO ruby**
* when returning an exception, remove the filename for the love of god.
* work on that is_assignment method so comparison operators not considered assignment
* there needs to be some massive cleanup/organization.
* Session might not be such a good class name due to sinatra sessions

**TODO js**
* evaluate function should have some line(s) changes to indicate eval
* cleanup the keydown function. Those conditionals are nasty.

**TODO misc**
* configure rackspace slice nginx
* deploy v1
