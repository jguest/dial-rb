def hello_world()
  # return something really cool here like "HELLO CRUEL WORLD"
  return "hello world!"
end

# save the file (big red button or ctrl-s) and
# text +18329812713 'hello_world()'

# run the code in this file with the big blue button or ctrl-enter

hello_world() + " :)"

# you can also define functions, classes, modules, etc. via
# sms, but since it is more of a playground, they will be cleared
# everytime you text 'reset' or 'exit' and will not show up here

# saving this file clears the memory of your sms session to
# keep things in sync, so hold on to that ruby sms thread!

# happy coding,
